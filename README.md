## What is RHEL Image Mode?

RHEL Image mode is a new approach for operating system deployment that enables users to create, deploy and manage Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a bootc container image.

This approach simplifies operations across the enterprise, allowing developers, operations teams and solution providers to use the same container-native tools and techniques to manage everything from applications to the underlying OS.

### How is RHEL Image Mode different?

Due to the container-oriented nature, RHEL Image mode opens up to a unification and standardization of OS management and deployment, allowing the integration with existing CI/CD workflows and/or GitOps, reducing complexity.

RHEL Image mode also helps increasing security as the content, updates and patches are predictable and atomic, preventing manual modification of core services, packages and applications for a guaranteed consistency at scale.

## 🎯🎯 Let's get started 🎯🎯

First of all, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/redhat-image-mode-demo
```

Now check out the [documentation website](https://redhat-cop.github.io/redhat-image-mode-demo/) for the step-by-step instructions of the use cases!

## Use Cases

In this repo you will find some use cases that explain and show RHEL Image mode in action!
