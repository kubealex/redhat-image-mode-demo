# Use Case - Running a bootc container providing Apache HTTP server

In this example, we will build a container image from a Containerfile and we will then use it as a source for a VM.

The Containerfile in the example:

- Updates packages
- Installs tmux and mkpasswd to create a simple user password
- Creates a *bootc-user* user in the image
- Adds the wheel group to sudoers
- Installs [Apache Server](https://httpd.apache.org/)
- Enables the systemd unit for httpd
- Adds a custom index.html

<details>
  <summary>Review Containerfile.httpd</summary>
  ```dockerfile
  --8<-- "use-cases/bootc-container-httpd/Containerfile.httpd"
  ```
</details>

## Building the image

From the root folder of the repository, switch to the use case directory:

```bash
cd use-cases/bootc-container-httpd
```

To build the image:

```bash
podman build -f Containerfile.httpd -t rhel-bootc-httpd .
```

## Testing the image

You can now test it using:

```bash
podman run -it --name rhel-bootc-httpd --hostname rhel-bootc-httpd -p 8080:80 rhel-bootc-httpd
```

Note: The *"-p 8080:80"* part forwards the container's *http* port to the port 8080 on the host to test that it is working.

The container will now start and a login prompt will appear.

On another terminal tab or in your browser, you can verify that the httpd server is working and serving traffic.

**Terminal**

```bash
 ~ ▓▒░ curl localhost:8080
```

**Browser**

## Exploring the container

If you are curious, you can easily log-in to the container using the prompt coming from the execution and the **bootc-user/redhat** user and password.

From here, you can verify that:

- The user has sudo privileges

```bash
[bootc-user@rhel-bootc-bootc ~]$ sudo su
bash-5.1# whoami
root
```

- There's systemd running

```bash
bash-5.1# systemctl status | more
● rhel-bootc-httpd
    State: running
    Units: 234 loaded (incl. loaded aliases)
     Jobs: 0 queued
   Failed: 0 units
    Since: Fri 2024-07-19 08:19:28 UTC; 1min 57s ago
```

- Apache is loaded as a systemd unit

```bash
bash-5.1# systemctl status httpd
● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; enabled; preset: disabled)
